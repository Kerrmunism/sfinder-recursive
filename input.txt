*p7
percent -c 5
true

// First line should be the seed you used to get the spin.html file. Using *p7 will also work.

// Second line should be the parameters for the command you want, excluding --tetfu (-t), --patterns (-p), --page (-P), --log-path (-lp) and --output-base (-o).

// Set the third line to "true" if you want to regenerate a new bag. Set the third line to false if you only want exactly the pieces that are in the seed in the first line and nothing else. Should be true in nearly every case unless you're doing something like a quiz solve.
