# sfinder-recursive
An addon to knewjade's sfinder that allows for automated searching of output files.

# Please note:
Currently this program only supports the spin, percent and path commands. It will accept others, but there is a high likelihood of it not working. You have been warned!

# Guide for usage

0.) Download sfinder from this link https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder/releases and put the sfinder.jar file into the same directory as this read me.

1.) Get a sfinder output file from a spin command being used. It will be named spin.html by default.

2.) Rename the file to output.html

3.) Move it into the same directory this file is in.

4.) Change the contents of "input.txt" according to what it says in the document.

5.) Run sfinderRecursable.exe

6.) Wait for the program to close, then run file.bat

7.) If you're okay with deleting the current output folder, put Y and then enter into the command prompt that will appear.

8.) That's it! If there are some errors, that's fine, as long as the command prompt window doesn't crash entirely.

You can ignore the lib and source folders.
