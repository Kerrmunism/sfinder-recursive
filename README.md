# sfinder-recursive
An addon to knewjade's sfinder that allows for automated searching of output files.

# Please note:
Currently this program only supports the spin, percent, cover and path commands. It will accept others, but there is a high likelihood of it not working. You have been warned!

# Note 2:
If you are using the cover command, include either -M tss, tsd, tst or b2b along with any other parameters, or you will get weird solves. tss, tsd and tst guarantee you get one of the names spins, and b2b ensures you get them with no skims.

# Guide for usage
0.) Download sfinder from this link https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder/releases and put the sfinder.jar file into the same directory as this read me.

1.) Get a sfinder output file from a spin command being used. It will be named spin.html by default.

2.) Rename the file to output.html

3.) Move it into the same directory this file is in.

4.) Change the contents of "input.txt" according to what it says in the document.

5.) Run sfinderRecursable.exe

6.) Wait for the program to close, then run file.bat

7.) If you're okay with deleting the current output folder, put Y and then enter into the command prompt that will appear.

8.) That's it! If there are some errors, that's fine, as long as the command prompt window doesn't crash entirely.

You can ignore the lib and source folders.
